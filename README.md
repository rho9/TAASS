# Software Development
In the package "RUDMarket" we developed a software to manage the web site and the mobile app of the made up RUDMarket. With this project it is possible to see and buy products, and to apply discounts to products if you have permission.
For the web site part, we used Spring and React frameworks.

In the packages "MavenEnterpriseApp" and "Cliente" we made a little project to manage a library and to learn the basics of Maven.
